                <p>I'm a University of Chicago alumna (BA '17, MS '18) working as a software engineer. I believe that good design is essential to obtaining success in today's visually driven world.
                <p>At UChicago, I studied a mixture of public policy, economics, and computer science, completing two degrees over five years. As a software engineer, I work on applications, web APIs, and automation optimization as part of a team focused on access management.
                <p>Though I haven't always known it, I'm truly an artist at heart. Visual design is my passion and I'm fascinated by the way design impacts those who interact with it. Human-Computer Interaction is an area of research I would like to pursue in the future.</p>

            <h3>NEO Radar</h3>
                <p><a class="underline" href="https://coxas.github.io/neo-radar/">NEO Radar</a> is a website that interacts with the NASA Near Earth Object <a class="underline" href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#neows-feed">API</a> to show all incoming Near Earth Objects for the next seven days. Objects can be filtered by speed and hazard status.</p>
                <p>The site uses JavaScript and JQuery to make an API call using AJAX. Specific data points are pulled out of the returned JSON and the DOM is updated accordingly in real time. The code is also available for view on <a class="underline"href="https://github.com/coxas/neo-radar">GitHub.</a></p><br/>
             <h3>Warehouse on the Web</h3>
                <p><a class="underline" href="https://warehouseontheweb.herokuapp.com/">Warehouse on the Web</a> is an example of a Software as a Service (SaaS) web application. Warehouse on the Web represents a modern warehouse fulfillment center that provides an HTTP-based web service so that sellers can build their own internal tools to keep track of their warehouse activities.</p>
                <p>The application is built in Rails and includes API endpoints that enable developers to use the service to store items, ship items, be notified of returned items, etc. The code is also available to view on <a class="underline"href="https://github.com/coxas/mpcs52554-hw3">GitHub.</a></p><br/>
            <h3>RuPaul 2020</h3>
                <p><a class="underline" href="https://rupaul2020.herokuapp.com/">RuPaul 2020</a> is a fully RESTful Ruby on Rails web app built from the ground up. It was built as a final project for a full-stack web development class that utilized Rails as a framework for learning how to interact with the web.</p>
                <p>RuPaul 2020 is an example of a simple campaign website that allows users to donate and send messages to the campaign, as well as view others' donations and messages. The guidelines and rules of the site, along with an explanation of how to use its features, can be found by clicking on the "User Stories" button in the top left or navigating to /help. The code is also available for view on <a class="underline"href="https://github.com/coxas/rupaul2020">GitHub.</a></p><br/>
            <h2>GitHub Projects</h2>
            <h3>Bias Buster</h3>
                <p><a class="underline" href="https://github.com/yuxi-wu/acrwyw122">Bias Buster</a> is a full-stack Flask web project that I and two other students completed in March of 2017. 
                <p>The Bias Buster website allows a user to enter the url of a current news article from a number of left- or right-learning sources (The Huffington Post, Breitbart News, etc) and recieve back a list of up to three articles on the same specific topic (for example, Paul Ryan's thoughts on the healthcare bill) but from sources that lean in the opposite direction of the input source.</p>
                <p>Present-day media can act as an echo chamber if we aren't careful--humans natually seek out sources that confirm their already existing beliefs. The goal of Bias Buster is to provide users with articles that challenge their view on a subject of their interest.</p>
                <p>Bias Buster incorporates the following techniques and technologies: Flask, web scraping using Beautiful Soup, web crawling, matching algorithms, and the Natural Language Tool Kit.</p>
            <h3>Blue Lotus</h3>
                <p><a class="underline" href="https://github.com/coxas/bluelotus">Blue Lotus</a> is a custom site for Blue Lotus Pyschological Services, a company located in Hyde Park, Chicago.</p>
                <p>The site utilizes responsive design to maximize the ease of user interaction on desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones. The site is currently under development, but the code is available to view on GitHub.</p>
