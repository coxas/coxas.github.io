            <h2>Live Sites</h2>
            <h3>RuPaul 2020</h2>
                <p><a class="underline" href="https://rupaul2020.herokuapp.com/">RuPaul 2020</a> is a fully RESTful Ruby on Rails web app built from the ground up. It was built as a final project for a full-stack web development class that utilized Rails as a framework for learning how to interact with the web.</p>
                <p>RuPaul 2020 is an example of a simple campaign website that allows users to donate and send messages to the campaign, as well as view others' donations and messages. The guidelines and rules of the site, along with an explanation of how to use its features, can be found by clicking on the "User Stories" button in the top left or navigating to /help. The code is also available for view on <a class="underline"href="https://github.com/coxas/rupaul2020">GitHub.</a></p><br/>
            <h2>GitHub Projects</h2>
            <h3>Bias Buster</h3>
                <p><a class="underline" href="https://github.com/yuxi-wu/acrwyw122">Bias Buster</a> is a full-stack Flask web project that I and two other students completed in March of 2017. 
                <p>The Bias Buster website allows a user to enter the url of a current news article from a number of left- or right-learning sources (The Huffington Post, Breitbart News, etc) and recieve back a list of up to three articles on the same specific topic (for example, Paul Ryan's thoughts on the healthcare bill) but from sources that lean in the opposite direction of the input source.</p>
                <p>Present-day media can act as an echo chamber if we aren't careful--humans natually seek out sources that confirm their already existing beliefs. The goal of Bias Buster is to provide users with articles that challenge their view on a subject of their interest.</p>
                <p>Bias Buster incorporates the following techniques and technologies: Flask, web scraping using Beautiful Soup, web crawling, matching algorithms, and the Natural Language Tool Kit.</p>
            <h3>Blue Lotus</h3>
                <p><a class="underline" href="https://github.com/coxas/bluelotus">Blue Lotus</a> is a custom site for Blue Lotus Pyschological Services, a company located in Hyde Park, Chicago.</p>
                <p>The site utilizes responsive design to maximize the ease of user interaction on desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones. The site is currently under development, but the code is available to view on GitHub.</p>
